<h3 align="left">Small Test file</h3>
<p align="left">In class we covered multiple approaches to implement a Web 
server: sequential (name it SeqWebServer), multi-thread (name it MtWebServer), and asynchronous i/o 
(name it AsyncWebServer).
The program below is a skeleton sequential web server: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><a href="java/WebServer.java">WebServer.java</a></p>
  </li>
	<li>
    <p align="left"><a href="java/WebRequestHandler.java">WebRequestHandler.java</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In this assignment, you will implement all three approaches and 
compare their performance. <br><br>For all three approaches, your server must 
support HTTP 1.0 (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html) GET and POST 
methods. The command-line syntax should allow specification of at least 
listening port and www_root.&nbsp; The server must send the Last-Modified header 
and understand If-Modified-Since from client. </p>
<p align="left">If the request is for www-root without specifying a file name, 
it should return index.html if exists; otherwise it will return Not found. If 
the request is for www-root without specifying a file name and the User-Agent 
header indicates that the request is from a mobile handset (e.g., it should at 
least detect iphone by detecting iPhone in the User-agent string),&nbsp; it 
should return index_m.html. <br><br>Some specific requirements for the 
multi-thread and async i/o versions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">For the multi-thread version, you should be able to specify 
	a limit on the maximal number of concurrent threads: -thmax &lt;max_num_current_threads&gt;.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">For the async i/o version, we covered an example
	<a href="java/EchoServer.java">EchoServer.java</a>. You can use the code as 
	a starting point. Your server should use ByteBuffer to read HTTP request and 
	write HTTP response. For details about ByteBuffer, please read chapter 12 of 
	Java Network Programming.</p>
	<p align="left">Suggestion 1: During your design, think how you 
		implement a finite state machine to handle each request (e.g., initial 
	state after accepting a connection, what other states).<br><br>Suggestion 2: 
	Java async io does not allow you to select events on a file channel. See
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/nio/channels/spi/AbstractSelectableChannel.html">
	this link</a> for a list of selectable channels. There are can be multiple 
	design options to handle file i/o:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left">Use standard file i/o by assuming that file system is 
		fast and will not become bottleneck;</p>
		</li>
		<li><span LANG="EN">
		<p>Try out mapped file i/o: <br><span LANG="EN">FileInputStream </span>
		<font SIZE="2">
		fin = new FileInputStream(args[0]);<br>FileChannel in = 
fin.getChannel();<br>ByteBuffer input = in.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0, 
in.size());</p>
</font></span></li>
		<li><span LANG="EN"><font SIZE="3">
		<p>Try out direct transfer: See FileChannel.transferTo;</p>
</font></span></li>
		<li><span LANG="EN"><font SIZE="3">
		<p>Use standard file i/o and use a thread pool to help with reading 
		files.</p>
</font></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4 align="left">Part 2.2 Testing</h4>
<p align="left">We will use <a
 href="http://www.acme.com/software/http_load/">http_load</a>
(http://www.acme.com/software/http_load/) to test the performance of
the servers. All related files are under
/home/httpd/html/zoo/classes/cs433/assignments/prog1/<br>
</p>
<p align="left">For this part of the assignment, you need to be able to
do the following:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use /home/httpd/html/zoo/classes/cs433/assignments/prog1/www as the www root<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure to set the www root of the three web servers so that a user can 
  retrieve files under the www root.
For example, if I am running a web server on
cicada.cs.yale.edu at port 9876, and I want to retrieve&nbsp;
/home/httpd/html/zoo/classes/cs433/assignments/prog1/www/html-small/doc1.html<br>
I can type into my browser:<br>
http://cicada.cs.yale.edu:9876/html-small/doc1.html<br>
    <br>
If I type an URL that does not map into an invalid file name, please
return Error and code 404.<br><br>
  <li>Test the performance of the servers using http_load. You may find
    <a
 href="http://ez.no/developer/articles/ez_publish_performance_optimization_part_1_of_3_introduction_and_benchmarking/performance_testing_with_http_load">this
    </a>document helpful. We have installed http_load under
/home/httpd/html/zoo/classes/cs433/assignments/prog1/http_load/<br>
An example url file is called urls.txt in the directory.<br>
    <br>
For the test, you will need to vary the parallel from 1 to 250 (or more
until your server saturates)
with a reasonable increment schedule (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, ...). A reasonable test time is 60 to
120 seconds.<br>
    <br>
Please conduct two test cases:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>All small html files. For this case, please use the 1000 files
under
/home/httpd/html/zoo/classes/cs433/assignments/prog1/www/html-small/</li>
    <li>A mix of small, big and jpg files: For this case, please use
the first 500 files from html-small, the 100 files from html-big, and
the 100 jpg files from jpg.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
<h4>Part 2.3 Report</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You should submit a report on your server design.
	<ul>
		<li>For your async i/o version, please (1) describe in what sense your 
		server implements a finite state machine to handle each request; (2) how 
		do you handle file i/o.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Please report the measured performance for performance metrics:
throughput and (mean) delay. <span class="line">The sample figure
below may
give you a sense of the
testing results for throughput. Please add one optimization feature of your 
		choice to speedup a server and
validate the
optimization. Thus, your results should contain at least four curves:
one curve for each given server, and one for your optimization.</span>
You may want to conduct a test using the department server
(http://zoo.cs.yale.edu) and compare the performance. Please discuss
the
lessons learned. </li>
		<li>The TA will benchmark all servers and pick the one with the highest 
		throughput. This server will receive a bonus of 25%.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<b>Submission</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Please submit using class server. Please include README to tell the TA 
  the directory structure, e.g., which file is the report, which directory is 
  part 1. Please generate a
single jar file containing all of your files. The name of the jar file
should be prog1.&lt;netid&gt;.jar. If you want to update, please rename
it prog1A.&lt;netid&gt;.jar, etc. </b></li>
</ul>
