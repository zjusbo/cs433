/**
 * Annotation which defines if a method <i>should</i> be called in 
 * multithreaded context (default) or not. This annotation can be used
 * to declare the desired execution modus of a call back method such as 
 * <code>onConnect</code> or <code>onData</code>. xSocket is free to
 * perform a NONTHREADED-annotated method in a MULTITHREADED mode.  
 * 
 * E.g.
 * <pre>
 *   class SmtpProtcolHandler implements IDataHandler, IConnectHandler {
 *      ...
 *
 *      &#064Execution(Execution.NONTHREADED)   // default is multithreaded
 *      public boolean onConnect(INonBlockingConnection connection) throws IOException {
 *          connection.write("220 my smtp server" + LINE_DELIMITER);
 *          return true;
 *      }
 *
 *
 *
 *      public boolean onData(INonBlockingConnection connection) throws IOException, BufferUnderflowException {
 *        ...
 *      }
 *   }
