 - The datagram size will vary as I get it from an external entity. The max 
size of datagram allowed for UDP is 64KB. I was wondering if xSocket can 
detect the size of datagram by itself, without I being to specify it 
specifically in the constructor.



 
 3.0 (includes non backward compatible API changes) 
========================================================
 [*] using NIO.2 internally and provide new NIO.2 interfaces such as AsynchronousChannel
 [connection] NonBlockingConnection- disable autoconnec. seehttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2964167&group_id=169583&atid=850945
 [connection] reuse ByteBuffer!
 [connection] readSignedByte(), readUnsignedeByte()
 [connection] NonBlockingConnection - don't call onData() by disconnecting?
 [connection] (Non)BlockingConnection - avoid overloaded constructors. Don't connect implicit, uses connect() instead
 [connection] (Non)BlockingConnection - only confusing thing is thread-model and sync/async flushing. if 
                                        don't combind thread-model and flushing mode properly, it will 
                                        lead strange result.
 [connection] (Non)BlockingConnection - break the API down into 3 classes: Connection, DataSink and DataSource. 
                                        Connection providesa getDataSink and getDataSource method, and all read
                                        and write method just available in Sink and Source.
 [connection] filterChain improvments
              -> " I have deep into mina's filterChain,  I found it so flexible(but a little tedious and complex).
              
                   for xsocket, it is separate callback into some callback interfaces (onData, onConnnect, etc), which 
                   is more simple and clear; and in xsocket, IOCallback is hidden in inner, which make callback for user more easy.
                   but sometimes, i need control the raw byteBuffer in receiving and sending, for examples, I wanna add gzip filter. 
                   now I could add just in onData callback. add a filter is not so easy, need modify Connection class.
                   
                   so, I check the mina's filterChain, i found it put filter in a stack, I could add Filter dynamicly. 
                   xsocket's HandlerChain is static, no nextFilter, cannot intercept packets handling.
                   and now, i wanna add codec upon xsocket, i found i need more operation with NonblockingConnection after
                   onData and before flush. 
                   
                   It is my suggestion of filterChain."
                 

 [connection] "sendFile" - improved, direct file support on IO level (Streaming-Files)
 [connection] readByte(), readInt performance optimizations by avoiding methdod readSingleByteBuffer!
 [connection] BlockingConnection(nbc) saves the assigned handler of the NonBlockingConnection?? really? possible side-effects!!!
 [connection] improved MapCache (CopyOnWriteMapCache????)
