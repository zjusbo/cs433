Release 2.1
-----------

   - [connection] NonBlockingConnection - getNumberOfReceivedBytes() & getNumberOfSendBytes() have become public  

b, Bug fix/Implementation changes:
   - [*] (robustness improvement) SerializedTaskQueue#performMultiThreaded: if given worker pool rejects the task, a dedicated daemon thread will be started by the SerializedTaskQueue
   - [connection] (improvement for non threaded mode) The IoSocketDispatcher first tries to write data by bypassing the selector. If this fails the appropriated selection key will be set
