<font style="font-size: 15px;" color="#000000" face="Arial">xSocket is
a lightweight java nio-based server framework to build high
performance, high scalable, multithreaded servers. <br>
<br>
One major goal of xSocket is the easy of use. With xSocket you can <br>
write multithreaded servers, without the need of thread handling/synchronisation.<br>
<br>
The framework itself consists of 3 major part. <br>
- The multithreaded server, which forwards new connections to the assigned Dispatchers (round robin algorithm). <br>
- The Dispatchers which perform the read and write operation on the
connection. By doing this, the Dispatcher calls the registered Handler.
<br>
- The Handler, which could be a ConnectHandler or a DataHandler or
both, is responsible to process the incoming data and to generate the
response</font>
