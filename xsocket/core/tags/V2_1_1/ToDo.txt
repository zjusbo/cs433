==============
 [connection] readByte(), readInt performance optimizations by avoiding methdod readSingleByteBuffer!
 [connection] BlockingConnection(nbc) saves the assigned handler of the NonBlockingConnection?? really? possible side-effects!!!
 [connection] improved flow control write buffer 
               -> requires call back support for (asychn) write operations -> see NIO.2 AsynchronousByteChannel
 [connection] improved, direct file support on IO level (Streaming-Files)
 [connection] improved MapCache (CopyOnWriteMapCache????)
 
 
 
 
 

... sometime in the future ..
 
ideas and issues that could be done/improved 
with 3.0 (big and/or NonBackwardCompatible
changes) 
============================================
 [*] using NIO.2 internal and provide NIO.2 interfaces such as AsynchronousChannel
 [connection] NonBlockingConnection - don't call onData() by disconnecting?
 [connection] (Non)BlockingConnection - avoid overloaded constructors. Don't connect implicit,
                                        uses connect() instead
