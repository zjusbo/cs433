1.8:

(Steve):  fixed bug in EmulatedNodeServer.java --  Packet.MAX_PACKET_SIZE
          should be EmulatorPacket.MAX_PACKET_SIZE

1.7:

(Steve):  fixed bug in Node.onReceive() spotted by Benjamin Hindman.  Bug would call a method on an object reference before verifying the reference was non-null.

(Safeer):  modified lib/Manager.java and lib/Packet.java so that
           if a node attempts to send a packet with TTL 0, the
           manager raises an exception
